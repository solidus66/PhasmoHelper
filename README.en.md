# Phasmo Helper

* [Russian README](https://github.com/solidus66/PhasmoHelper/blob/main/README.md)

This is an improved "journal" for the game Phasmophobia. It was created for personal use to quickly select the "Ghost Orb" evidence without fear of forgetting it or missing The Mimic.

Phasmophobia version at the time of utility creation - v0.9.4.1

#### Description of the Implemented Functionality:

When launching the .exe file, the app starts in Russian. You can change it to English by navigating to Language -> English. The window opens on the "Evidence" tab with buttons corresponding to ghost evidence for the game Phasmophobia (v0.9.4.1).

You can select evidence by clicking on the corresponding buttons. Buttons with incompatible evidence will be disabled.

In case of an error or the need to cancel selected evidence, you can press the "Clear" button. This will return the app to its initial state.

The "Description" tab by default contains descriptions of all types of ghosts.

When selecting specific evidence on the "Evidence" tab, only the relevant ghosts are displayed on the "Description" tab.
